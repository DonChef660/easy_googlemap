What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- A simple customizable Google Maps extension that displays 1 or more
  locations on your website.

What can you do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You can create as many records as you want
- You can upload a custom marker icon if you want to
- If you don't have a custom marker icon or you want to keep the default
  Google marker then just don't upload any icon. The default one will
  appear by itself.
- When infobox is checked, title will appear in a small box on the frontend map.
- Drag and move the icon to choose your location or just enter your address into the address fields. 
  Your marker will move automatically and update the longitude and latitude values.
- You can set two anchor values for your custom marker. 
  Negative values on X-anchor moves the marker to the right and positive values moves 
  him to the left. On Y-anchor positive values moves the marker up and negative moves him down. 
  The preview of the custom marker will be shown after refreshing the page. Your chosen marker point should be
  exactly on the anchor point cross. While you are changing the anchor values, 
  your longitude and latitude wont change.
